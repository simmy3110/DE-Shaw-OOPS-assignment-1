# DE-Shaw-OOPS-assignment-1
Design a technical/cultural fest management platform for a college using Object Oriented Programming. This platform is used to manage the people and also the events / activities that occur during a fest in college.

Few of the major classes and their descriptions are listed below:
Participant  : The students who participate in the events that are conducted during a fest.

Core Members : The entire fest is managed by few core committee members each of which are specialized in a particular area (like logistics, treasury, publicity, website lead). Also each core member will have a few coordinators under them to help them in managing some specific activities/events.                               

Coordinators : Every event / activity that is conducted during the fest is managed by a coordinator. Each coordinator can coordinate multiple events / activities as well. Coordinators report to Core members and also have a few workforce members under them.
Workforce : Students who help the coordinators in conducting their respective events / activities.

Identify the objects, methods and the relationship between them to define classes using concepts of Object Oriented Programming. Recall the concepts covered in the first lecture of OOPs â€“ constructors, destructors, inheritance and dive into the world of Object Oriented Programming.


Note: Make appropriate assumptions wherever required.
